## To Do's

- The styling is fine, but my intention is to add a responsive D3 map or globe. This map will coorespond to the places from the lists. 
- add validation on email registration & password
- Use Google API to get accurate location names
- Maybe use Google Places to get info about a place. Then set a "trip style" that would gives results related to the type of trip.
